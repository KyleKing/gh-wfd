## See Also

[gh-dispatch](https://github.com/mdb/gh-dispatch) is a CLI-based alternative that supports both `workflow_dispatch` and `repository_dispatch` with JSON payloads via command-line flags. Use gh-dispatch for scripting, CI integration, or repository_dispatch events; use lazydispatch for interactive exploration, frecency-based history, and guided input configuration.

Other alternatives:

- [chrisgavin/gh-dispatch](https://github.com/chrisgavin/gh-dispatch) - Interactive CLI for dispatching workflows with progress tracking
- [gh workflow run](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_workflow_run) - Built-in `gh` command with basic interactive prompts
- [nektos/act](https://github.com/nektos/act) - Run GitHub Actions locally in Docker (different use case: local testing vs remote dispatch)

## Installation

### As a GitHub CLI Extension (Recommended)

```bash
gh extension install KyleKing/lazydispatch
```

Then run with:

```bash
gh lazydispatch
```

### Standalone Binary

```bash
go install github.com/kyleking/gh-lazydispatch@latest
```

Or build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kyleking/gh-lazydispatch
cd lazydispatch
go build
```

## Usage

Navigate to a directory with a Git repository containing GitHub Actions workflows:

```bash
cd your-project

# If installed as gh extension:
gh lazydispatch

# If installed as standalone:
lazydispatch
```

The tool will discover all workflows with `workflow_dispatch` triggers and present them in an interactive TUI.

## Workflow Chains

Chains let you execute multiple workflows in sequence with configurable wait conditions and failure handling. Define chains in `.github/lazydispatch.yml`:

```yaml
version: 1
chains:
  deploy-all:
    description: Build, test, and deploy to all environments
    steps:
      - workflow: build.yml
        wait_for: success      # Wait for successful completion (default)
        on_failure: abort      # Stop chain on failure (default)
      - workflow: test.yml
        wait_for: completion   # Wait for any completion (success or failure)
        on_failure: continue   # Continue even if this step fails
      - workflow: deploy.yml
        wait_for: none         # Don't wait, dispatch immediately
        inputs:
          environment: production
          version: v1.0.0

  quick-test:
    description: Run tests with default settings
    steps:
      - workflow: test.yml
```

### Chain Options

| Option | Values | Default | Description |
|--------|--------|---------|-------------|
| `wait_for` | `success`, `completion`, `none` | `success` | When to proceed to next step |
| `on_failure` | `abort`, `skip`, `continue` | `abort` | What to do when step fails |
| `inputs` | map | - | Override workflow inputs |

### Accessing Chains

1. Press `Tab` to focus the right panel
2. Press `l` to switch to the Chains tab
3. Navigate with `j`/`k` and press `Enter` to execute

The status bar shows `Chains(N)` when chains are configured, and `Chain: name (step/total)` during execution.

## Log Viewer

View workflow run logs directly in the TUI with filtering, search, and real-time streaming.

### Accessing Logs

- **From Chain Status**: Press `l` after a chain completes or fails
- **From History**: Select a history entry and press `l`

### Features

- **Step Navigation**: Logs are organized by workflow step with tabs
- **Filtering**: Cycle through all/errors/warnings with `f`
- **Search**: Press `/` to search, `n`/`N` to navigate matches
- **Live Streaming**: Logs update in real-time for active runs
- **Error Focus**: When opened from a failed chain, automatically filters to errors

### Requirements

Log viewing requires `gh` CLI to be installed and authenticated:

```bash
gh auth login
```

## Recording the Demo

Generate the demo GIFs using VHS:

```bash
# Main demo
